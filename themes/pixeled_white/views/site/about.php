<h2>The story of Smoothcoder</h2>
<p>
Smoothcoder was - long, long time ago - an engineer working for the big blue company in France. Later she involved herself deeply into the rise and fall of an internet bubble company together with her husband.
She throwed in the towel to raise her children and with her familly, Smoothmother leaved France to the far east frontier : China.</p>
<p>
She enjoyed teaching French in a College in Zhuhai, China. ( Teaching, transmitting knowledge, watching the transformation af a teenager to an adult is immensely rewarding ).
At that time she called herself Smoothzhuhai.</p>
<p>
After two years, her son returned to France for his engineering studies at the University, and her daugter after so many years of home schooling needed to attend a real school.
Mmm. Smoothtraveller who didn't know a word of  Spanish decided to leave to South America. After all, that's not as difficult as learning Chinese ? Suree ...
</p>
<p>
For instance, Smoothtraveller lives in Argentina. In the meantime, her soon 18 years old daughter wrote a mystery novel for teens. To support this talented artist who also writes her songs, Smoothmother decided to become smoothcoder in order to offer a blog to her beloved daughter.
Smoothcoder discovered Yii framework and rediscovered php programming. Now that she's really hooked to it, she wants to thank the Yii framework community who helped this happen.
